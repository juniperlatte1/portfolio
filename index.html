        <p> Hey there! My name is Courtney Brown, but my friends call me Court and so can you. I am a dedicated full
            stack software developer with
            a keen interest in crafting elegant, scalable code solutions. I have a deep love for all elements of
            aesthetic
            and functional design; creation is my life-blood. I am your one-stop shop for web development so, really, do
            you need to look any further?
            Rest assured, you do not.

            As a software engineer, I understand the importance of balancing technical prowess with a deep empathy for
            the needs of end-users, and I take
            pride in crafting code solutions that are as elegant as they are practical. In addition to a strong
            commitment to my craft, I am also a lifelong
            learner, constantly striving to expand my skill set and knowledge base. Ultimately, I view software
            engineering as an opportunity to make
            a meaningful impact on the world around me, and I am excited to continue exploring this dynamic field
            alongside like-minded individuals who share
            my passion for innovation and excellence.

            I value clear communication, proactiveness, and personal responsibility in the work place. Professional
            relationships are of the upmost
            importance to me. Afterall, we spend most of our lives commited to our crafts. As such, I also value humor
            and I am not above cracking a joke while meeting
            goals. For example, Why did the programmer quit her job? Because she didn't get arrays! See? Hilarious.

            In my free time, I enjoy listening to audiobooks, crocheting, and running with my Giant Schnauzer, Sugar. I
            can often be found in
            a coffee shop diving into the latest tech developments and researching ways to implement new innovations
            into my work.

            Let's connect over a (virtual or in-person) cup of Joe to discuss exactly what I can add to your team. I
            look foward to hearing from you!
